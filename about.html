        <h2>About Co-lab</h2>
        <p>Co-lab is an attempt to bring people with different musical preferences together. Most people who make music together on a non-proffesioial level 
            have similar musical backgrounds and preferences. This is quite natural and not inherently wrong. It is however limiting in what can be accomplished 
            music wise. 
            If you get the tools to meet people with different musical preferences than yourself, it will influence how your music sounds.

            I think that besides the music itself. Mixing people from different genres can also bring people from different sub-cultures and groups togheter.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Johan Wennerstr√∂m and I am a 25 year old located in Stockholm. I have always had a passion for music, and as of late I have found a new 
            passion in web-development. 
            I started to learn coding about 1,5 months ago. I have mainly relied on online sources for learning html and css as well as some of my close friends
            who have helped me in my learning.
            When working on this website I have gotten better along the way. I now see some things in my code that I would avoid were i to do it again. It is however
            part of showing that this was indeed a process for me. When I started putting this idea in to code, I had no idea where to start. Now I feel that I 
            have done my idea justice in terms of presenting it on a website like this.
